    "text": "So a couple years ago on Memorial Day, I went caching with my buddy ocie_mitchell and one of his kids.  We talked about this puzzle, and we determined what we needed to do.  But I had to leave before we got the solution, and then Ocie went and solved it on his own! So I was stuck until about a week ago, and then I realized that I could solve it on my own after all.  It wasn't so much learning something new as remembering something old.  I'm filling my puzzle calendar, and I needed one for today, so I headed over to make the find.  No problems making the find.  This is a fantastic puzzle, and I'm glad to give it a favorite point.  12 more puzzle days to go.  TFTP and C!",
